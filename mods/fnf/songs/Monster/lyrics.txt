Guess it's time,
you bet/ter plug in all your night/lights

What's out there, past your dark/ened door?

Just the eyes floa/ting up out of the shore

Hey man, I'm gon/na eat your girl/friend

Or may/be turn her in/to broth
la-/la-/la la la

Kill a kid, cut 'em up
stuff 'em up in/side of my, se/cret meat box

Find my, hands a/cross your bo/dy, slow/ly
peel your skin off

You'll meet your friends,

in/side the am/bu/lance

Call in/to the night

to the were/wolf

Give all your blood to him

stand un/der the warm street light

Let your/self be hyp/no/tized

You're just a lit/tle snack,
and so is your girl/friend

And then, I'm gon/na tear your eyes out

and then I'll boil your girl/friend,
la-/la-/la la la

Kill a kid, cut 'em up
stuff 'em up in/side of my, bur/ning dun/geon

I would give you guys a lit/tle break but I'm not Sa/tan
