Feas/ting with your friends
the per/fect way to end all these lone/ly ho/li/days
la-la-la-la

Gon/na take a piece of your ra/bies
and vi/vi/sect your mind

Snow/men smi/ling with your teeth
fall/en an/gels cre/a/ted with your meat

That pear/ly smile

Cut in a thou/sand sli/ces

Se/pa/rate you from your eyes
turn your girl/friend in/side out
burn her fin/ger/nails
la-la-la-la

Soak your hands in free/zing wa/ter

watch/ing as the skin gets soft/er

See your bones ap/pear in dark red snow
drop fur/ther be/low
Gon/na take a piece of your ra/bies
and vi/vi/sect your mind
Gon/na take a peek in/side your head
and find the worm in/side
Cut in a thou/sand sli/ces
bake you 'til gold/en brown

Fill you with spi/ces

serve to friends a/round

Turn the heat on high
and we'll re/duce your blood

Boil lit/tle boy/friend

with bran/dy and plums
