E/pic Rap Bat/tles of His/to/ry!
Babe Ruth, ver/sus
Lance Arm/strong!
Be/gin!
Be/fore I let loose with this ruth/less ag/gres/sion,
I'll let you be the se/cond fat wo/man hear/ing my con/fes/sion!
I ad/mit it: I did what I had to do to win.
I'm an ath/lete. You're a spe/ci/men of sin!
With your drin/king and smo/king and cho/king down food,
I know French dudes with bet/ter man/ners than you!
So swing, bat/ter bat/ter! Show me what a fat/ter rap/per can do!
I beat can/cer! I can sure as hell crack you!
You\slived\sstrong; beat can/cer. Con/gra/tu/la/tions!
Now I'll drop your ass fas/ter than your own foun/da/tion!
Third base with an Ol/sen twin; that's the sin, face it!
She's just a lit/tle girl! What'd you give her, a brace/let?
The\swhole na/tion knows you ride too tight in the crotch!
You're as bo/ring as your Tour de France is to watch,
So come on, lit/tle bud/dy! Don't look so pissed!
With all that blood and at/ti/tude, you're like a mens/trual cy/clist!
You\sset re/cords be/fore black men could com/pete; are you kid/ding me?
That's like ha/ving a pas/ta con/test with/out I/ta/ly!
You're an or/phan who found his way to for/tune and fame.
Just think what you could/'ve done if you would/'ve ac/tual/ly trained!
I'm the pin/na/cle of phy/si/cal con/di/tion,
While you dip your stick in pros/ti/tutes and call it fo/ul tip/pin'; are you trip/pin'?
You'll be no/thing but a ske/le/ton, mes/sing with the fel/low in yel/low
Who will be pe/da/ling like hell up in the pe/lo/ton!
It's\sthe bot/tom of the ninth a/gainst the Tex/an in a bath/ing suit,
Filled with more ar/ti/fi/cial in/gre/dients than a Ba/by Ruth.
It may be way too soon, but I'm cal/ling my shot,
And I'm not tal/king a/bout those I/ta/lian sy/rin/ges you brought!
The Sul/tan of Swat will knock you right out of the park,
And round the ba/ses to the sound of up/roa/ring ap/plause,
While you hang your head in shame and dis/grace be/cause
You got lost and for/got what re/al sports/man/ship was!
You look ti/red, kid. You got Sher/yl Crow's feet eyes.
Pe/dal home to France and may/be bring me back some fries,
'Cause if you step to Ruth on the mic, I'll fan your fan/cy bike and all.
Yerrr out, with three strikes, and just one ball!
